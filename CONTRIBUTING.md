## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Begin by forking my project's repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a personal copy of the codebase that you can work on without affecting the main project.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local development environment using the following command:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repo.git
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work. Name your branch clearly and concisely to reflect the purpose of your changes.
   ```shell
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Make Changes**: Work on your code improvements or bug fixes within your branch. Keep your code clean, readable, and follow the [Java coding conventions](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-contents.html).

5. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure your code changes don't introduce new issues and that it passes any existing tests. Feel free to write new tests if needed to cover your changes.

6. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and informative commit message describing the purpose of your changes. Reference any related issues or pull requests.
   ```shell
   git commit -m "Add a concise and informative commit message here"
   ```

7. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
   ```shell
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request**: Visit the main repository and create a pull request from your forked branch to the `main` branch of the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes and any relevant context.

## Code Review

Once you've submitted your pull request, it will go through a friendly and relaxed code review process. I'm here to help and ensure your contributions blend smoothly into the project. If I have any feedback or suggestions, rest assured that it will be kept concise and easy to understand. The goal is to improve the codebase collaboratively without causing any undue stress or prolonged discussions.

Your efforts are highly appreciated, and I'm excited to work together to enhance the project!
